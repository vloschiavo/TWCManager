# What's TWCManager good for?
#
# This script (TWCManager) pretends to be a Tesla Wall Charger (TWC) set to
# master mode. When wired to the IN or OUT pins of real TWC units set to slave
# mode (rotary switch position F), TWCManager can tell them to limit car
# charging to any whole amp value between 5A and the max rating of the charger.
# Charging can also be stopped so the car goes to sleep.
#
# This level of control is useful for having TWCManager track the real-time
# availability of green energy sources and direct the slave TWCs to use near the
# exact amount of energy available. This saves energy compared to sending the
# green energy off to a battery for later car charging or off to the grid where
# some of it is lost in transmission.
#
# TWCManager can also be set up to only allow charging during certain hours,
# stop charging if a grid overload or "save power day" is detected, reduce
# charging on one TWC when a "more important" one is plugged in, or whatever
# else you might want to do.
#
# One thing TWCManager does not have direct access to is the battery charge
# percentage of each plugged-in car. There are hints on forums that some TWCs
# do report battery state, but we have yet to see a TWC send such a message.
# It's possible the feature exists in TWCs with newer firmware.
# This is unfortunate, but if you own a Tesla vehicle being charged, people have
# figured out how to get its charge state by contacting Tesla's servers using
# the same password you use in the Tesla phone app. Be very careful not to
# expose that password because it allows unlocking and starting the car.

# Overview of protocol TWCs use to load share
#
# A TWC set to slave mode (rotary switch position F) sends a linkready message
# every 10 seconds.
# The message contains a unique 4-byte id that identifies that particular slave
# as the sender of the message.
#
# A TWC set to master mode sees a linkready message. In response, it sends a
# heartbeat message containing the slave's 4-byte id as the intended recipient
# of the message.
# The master's 4-byte id is included as the sender of the message.
#
# Slave sees a heartbeat message from master directed to its unique 4-byte id
# and responds with its own heartbeat message containing the master's 4-byte id
# as the intended recipient of the message.
# The slave's 4-byte id is included as the sender of the message.
#
# Master sends a heartbeat to a slave around once per second and expects a
# response heartbeat from the slave.
# Slaves do not send heartbeats without seeing one from a master first. If
# heartbeats stop coming from master, slave resumes sending linkready every 10
# seconds.
# If slaves stop replying to heartbeats from master, master's behavior is more
# complex but it generally keeps trying to contact the slave at less frequent
# intervals and I think it gives up eventually.
#
# Heartbeat messages contain a 7-byte data block used to negotiate the amount of
# power available to each slave and to the master.
# The first byte is a status indicating things like is TWC plugged in, does it
# want power, is there an error, etc.
# Next two bytes indicate the amount of power requested or the amount allowed in
# 0.01 amp increments.
# Next two bytes indicate the amount of power being used to charge the car, also in
# 0.01 amp increments.
# Last two bytes seem to be unused and always contain a value of 0.

# Configuration parameters
#

# Most users will have only one ttyUSB adapter plugged in and the default value
# of '/dev/ttyUSB0' below will work. If not, run 'dmesg |grep ttyUSB' on the
# command line to find your rs485 adapter and put its ttyUSB# value in the
# parameter below.
# If you're using a non-USB adapter like an RS485 shield, the value may need to
# be something like '/dev/serial0'.
my $rs485Adapter = '/dev/ttyUSB0';

# Set $wiringMaxAmpsAllTWCs to the maximum number of amps your charger wiring
# can handle. I default this to a low 6A which should be safe with the minimum
# standard of wiring in the areas of the world that I'm aware of.
# Most U.S. chargers will be wired to handle at least 40A and sometimes 80A,
# whereas EU chargers will handle at most 32A (using 3 AC lines instead of 2 so
# the total power they deliver is similar).
# Setting $wiringMaxAmpsAllTWCs too high will trip the circuit breaker on your
# charger at best or START A FIRE if the circuit breaker malfunctions.
# Keep in mind that circuit breakers are designed to handle only 80% of their
# max power rating continuously, so if your charger has a 50A circuit breaker,
# put 50 * 0.8 = 40 here.
# 40 amp breaker * 0.8 = 32 here.
# 30 amp breaker * 0.8 = 24 here.
# 100 amp breaker * 0.8 = 80 here.
# IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT TO PUT HERE, ASK THE ELECTRICIAN WHO INSTALLED YOUR
# CHARGER.

# If all your chargers share a single circuit breaker, set $wiringMaxAmpsPerTWC
# to the same value as $wiringMaxAmpsAllTWCs.
# Rarely, each TWC will be wired to its own circuit breaker. If you're
# absolutely sure your chargers each have a separate breaker, put the value of
# that breaker * 0.8 here, and put the sum of all breakers * 0.8 as the value of
# $wiringMaxAmpsAllTWCs.
# For example, if you have two TWCs each with a 50A breaker, set
# $wiringMaxAmpsPerTWC = 50 * 0.8 = 40 and $wiringMaxAmpsAllTWCs = 40 + 40 = 80.
my $wiringMaxAmpsPerTWC = 6;

# After determining how much green energy is available for charging, we add
# $greenEnergyAmpsOffset to the value. This is most often given a negative value
# equal to the average amount of power consumed by everything other than car
# charging. For example, if your house uses an average of 2.8A to power
# computers, lights, etc while you expect the car to be charging, set
# $greenEnergyAmpsOffset = -2.8.
#
# If you have solar panels, look at your utility meter while your car charges.
# If it says you're using 0.67kW, that means you should set
# $greenEnergyAmpsOffset = -0.67kW * 1000 / 240V = -2.79A assuming you're on the

# The gateway also communicates with Tesla's servers to upload statistics 
# periodically.  We can poll the gateway very frequently to get updated stats
# in JSON format over http.  If enabled and configured this script will poll the
# instantaneous grid power and use that as the green energy source.

# router's DHCP leases and look for one you don't recognize.  Alternatively,
# If your subnet was 192.168.100.0/24 (192.168.100.0-192.168.100.255) then I'd 
# suggest the following nmap command to narrow down the list.  Look for a system
# identified as linux and a MAC address registered to Winsystems.  See example
# below:
# $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nmap
# $ nmap -sS -O -p80 192.168.100.0/24
#
# Sample nmap output:
# Nmap scan report for 192.168.100.100		<------ your IP will likely be different
# Host is up (0.00035s latency).
# PORT   STATE SERVICE
# 80/tcp open  http
# MAC Address: 00:01:45:07:BE:EF (Winsystems)      <--- your mac will be different
# Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port
# Device type: general purpose
# Running: Linux 3.X
# OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:3
# OS details: Linux 3.11 - 3.14
# Network Distance: 1 hop

# In the above example you should set $powerwallIP = "192.168.100.100";

# These messages will contain commands like "start charging at 10A" or may ask
# for information like "how many amps is the solar array putting out".
#
# The message queue is identified by a numeric key. This script and the web
# interface must both use the same key. The "ftok" function facilitates creating
# such a key based on a shared piece of information that is not likely to
# conflict with keys chosen by any other process in the system.
#

# parameter. This file or dir must already exist and the permissions on it don't
# seem to matter. The inode of a particular file or dir is fairly unique but
# doesn't change often so it makes a decent choice for a key.  We use the parent
# directory of the TWCManager script.
#
# The second parameter to ftok is a single byte that adds some additional
# uniqueness and lets you create multiple queues linked to the file or dir in
# the first param. We use 'T' for Tesla.

    # When master is powered on or reset, it sends 5 to 7 copies of this
    # linkready1 message followed by 5 copies of linkready2 (I've never seen
    # more or less than 5 of linkready2).
    #
    # This linkready1 message advertises master's ID to other slaves on the
    # network.
    # If a slave happens to have the same id as master, it will pick a new
    # random ID. Other than that, slaves don't seem to respond to linkready1.

    # linkready1 and linkready2 are identical except fc e1 is replaced by fb e2
    # in bytes 2-3. Both messages will cause a slave to pick a new id if the
    # slave's id conflicts with master. Only linkready2 will cause a slave to
    # respond immediately with its own linkready message (though I'm not
    # absolutely sure about that).
    # If a slave stops sending heartbeats for awhile, master may send a series
    # of linkready1 and linkready2 messages in seemingly random order, which
    # means they don't indicate any sort of startup state.

    # linkready1 is not sent again after boot/reset unless a slave sends its
    # ready_to_link message.
    # At that point, linkready1 message may start sending every 1-5 seconds, or
    # it may not be sent at all.
    # Behaviors I've seen:
    #   Not sent at all as long as slave keeps responding to heartbeat messages
    #   right from the start.
    #   If slave stops responding, then re-appears, linkready1 gets sent
    #   frequently.

    # One other possible purpose of linkready1 and/or linkready2 is to trigger
    # an error condition if two TWCs on the network transmit those messages.
    # That means two TWCs have rotary switches setting them to master mode and I
    # believe they will both flash their red LED 4 times with top green light on
    # if that happens.

    # Also note that linkready1 starts with fc e1 which is similar to the fc d1
    # message that masters send out every 4 hours when idle. Oddly, the fc d1
    # message contains all zeros instead of the master's id, so it seems
    # pointless.

    # I don't understand the purpose of having both linkready1 and linkready2
    # but it doesn't seem to matter. If anyone figures it out, contact
    # user CDragon at teslamotorsclub.com because I'm curious.

    #
    # Heartbeat includes 7 bytes of data we store in @slaveHeartbeatData.
    # Meaning of 7 bytes:
    #
    # Byte 1 values I've seen with guesses at meaning:
    #   00 Ready (may or may not be plugged in)
    #   01 Plugged in, charging
    #   02 Lost communication with master
    #      I usually see this status briefly if I stop fake master script for
    #      awhile, then start it.  This value may also indicate other error
    #      conditions.
    #   03 Plugged in, do not charge
    #      I've seen this state briefly when plug is first inserted, and I've
    #      seen this state remain indefinitely after pressing stop charge on
    #      car's screen or when the car reaches its target charge percentage. It
    #      may also remain indefinitely if TWCManager script is stopped for too
    #      long while car is charging even after TWCManager is restarted. In
    #      that case, car will not charge even when start charge on screen is
    #      pressed - only re-plugging in charge cable fixes it.
    #   04 Plugged in, ready to charge or charge scheduled
    #      I've seen this state even when car is set to charge at a future time
    #      via its UI.  In that case, it won't accept power offered to it.
    #   05 Busy?
    #      I've only seen it hit this state for 1 second at a time and it can
    #      seemingly happen during any other state. Maybe it means wait, I'm
    #      busy? Communicating with car? When Master sends 05, slave takes it as
    #      meaning the next four bytes contain a max charging amps value, but it
    #      doesn't seem that slave uses it in the same way.
    #   08 Starting to charge?
    #      This state may remain for a few seconds while car ramps up from 0A
    #      to 1.3A, then state usually changes to 01. Sometimes car skips 08
    #      and goes directly to 01.
    #      I saw 08 consistently each time I stopped my fake master script with
    #      car scheduled to charge, plugged in, charge port blue. If the car is
    #      actually charging and you stop TWCManager, after 20-30 seconds the
    #      charge port turns solid red, steering wheel display says "charge
    #      cable fault", and main screen says "check charger power". When
    #      TWCManager is started, it sees this 08 status again. If we start
    #      TWCManager and send the slave a new max power value, 08 becomes 00
    #      and car starts charging again.
    #
    # Byte 2-3 is the max current available as provided by bytes 2-3 in our
    # fake master status.
    # For example, if bytes 2-3 are 0f a0, combine them as 0x0fa0 hex which
    # is 4000 in base 10. Move the decimal point two places left and you get
    # 40.00Amps max.
    # Note that once bytes 2-3 are greater than 0, Byte 1 changes from 04 to
    # 01 or 00 during charging.
    #
    # Byte 4-5 represents the power the car is actually drawing for charging.
    # When a car is told to charge at 19A you may see a value like 07 28 which is
    # 0x728 hex or 1832 in base 10. Move the decimal point two places left
    # and you see the charger is using 18.32A.
    # Some TWCs report 0A when a car is not charging while others may report
    # small values such as 0.25A. I suspect 0A is what should be reported and
    # any small value indicates a minor calibration error.
    #
    # Byte 6-7 are always 00 00 from what I've seen and could be reserved
    # for future use or may be used in a situation I've not observed.

    ###############################
    # How was the above determined?
    #
    # An unplugged slave sends a status like this:
    #   00 00 00 00 19 00 00
    #
    # A real master always sends all 00 status data to a slave reporting the
    # above status. $slaveHeartbeatData[0] is the main driver of how master
    # responds, but whether $slaveHeartbeatData[1] and [2] have 00 or non-00
    # values also matters.
    #
    # I did a test with fake slave sending $slaveHeartbeatData[0] values
    # from 00 to ff along with $slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] of 00 and whatever
    # value Master last responded with. I found:
    #   Slave sends:     04 00 00 00 19 00 00
    #   Master responds: 05 12 c0 00 00 00 00
    #
    #   Slave sends:     04 12 c0 00 19 00 00
    #   Master responds: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    #
    #   Slave sends:     08 00 00 00 19 00 00
    #   Master responds: 08 12 c0 00 00 00 00
    #
    #   Slave sends:     08 12 c0 00 19 00 00
    #   Master responds: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    #
    # In other words, master always sends all 00 unless slave sends
    # $slaveHeartbeatData[0] 04 or 08 with $slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] both 00.
    #
    # I interpret all this to mean that when slave sends
    # $slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] both 00, it's requesting a max power from
    # master. Master responds by telling the slave how much power it can
    # use. Once the slave is saying how much max power it's going to use
    # ($slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] = 12 c0 = 32.00A), master indicates that's
    # fine by sending 00 00.
    #
    # However, if the master wants to set a lower limit on the slave, all it
    # has to do is send any $heartbeatData[1-2] value greater than 00 00 at
    # any time and slave will respond by setting its
    # $slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] to the same value.
    #
    # I thought slave might be able to negotiate a lower value if, say, the
    # car reported 40A was its max capability or if the slave itself could
    # only handle 80A, but the slave dutifully responds with the same value
    # master sends it even if that value is an insane 655.35A. I tested
    # these values on my car which has a 40A limit when AC charging and
    # slave accepts them all:
    #   0f aa (40.10A)
    #   1f 40 (80.00A)
    #   1f 41 (80.01A)
    #   ff ff (655.35A)

    #   02 Error
    #     I saw this from a real master TWC when I caused it to blink its

            # Seeing $self->{reportedAmpsActual} < 4.0 means the car hasn't
            # ramped up to whatever level we told it to charge at last time. It
            # may be asleep and take up to 15 minutes to wake up, see there's
            # power, and start charging.
            #
            # Unfortunately, $self->{reportedAmpsActual} < 4.0 can also mean the
            # car is at its target charge level and may not accept power for
            # days until the battery drops below a certain level. I can't think
            # of a reliable way to detect this case. When the car stops itself
            # from charging, we'll see $self->{reportedAmpsActual} drop to near
            # 0.0A and $heartbeatData[0] becomes 03, but we can see the same 03

            # for some period of time, but we can't reliably detect if someone
            # unplugged the car, drove it, and re-plugged it so it now needs
            # power, or if someone plugged in a different car that needs power.
            # Even if I see the car hasn't taken the power we've offered for the
            # last hour, it's conceivable the car will reach a battery state
